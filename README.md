# macOS Setup

This repository contains *my* macOS setup. It may work for you, but this one is made for myself. It's not designed to be configurable to tailor anyone's needs except for mine.

Anyone is of course welcome to fork this project and taylor it to their needs.

## Prerequisites

* A **blank** computer running macOS 10.14 (Mojave)
* Command Line Tools (they can be installed with `xcode-select --install`)
* Sign-in into the Apple Store app

## Installation

Just execute the `run` script, everything is taken care of: `./run`

### Manual steps

Alas I couldn't automate everything, so here are the things that (still) need to be done manually:

* Configure screen resolution
* Maps caps lock to control

## Acknowledgements
